## Bnmr = Bryan's NMR software.

---

This repository contains Arduino files that compose the software for an Earth Field NMR instrument. For history and general updates, please consult my [blog](https://chemospec.org). Search for "EF-NMR".

* This code is tested with Arduino Uno R3 hardware.
* Code is written in ANSI C as described in K&R, except of course for the changes that Arduino implements/requires.

Released under GPL-3, help yourself *if you dare*.  After all, it is a WIP and I am new to `C` and `Arduino`.  Code here is not likely to be "ideal" for some definitions of "ideal".
